# ðŸ§¾ Risk Assessments

This folder contains risk assessments and registers created during my GRC training.

### Included:
- âœ… A basic **Risk Register** using the NIST 800-30 framework
- âœ… A **Fictional Company Risk Report** identifying key vulnerabilities
- âœ… A **Threat Likelihood & Impact Matrix** for prioritizing issues

These projects show my understanding of risk analysis, risk scoring, and controls recommendation.
